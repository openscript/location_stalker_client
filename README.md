# Location Stalker Client
This is a demonstration application, which shows how [Location Stalker](https://github.com/openscript/location_stalker) could be used.

## Usage
1. Clone this git repository
2. Open `index.html` with a modern browser

## Issues
 - Google Chrome dosent ask for GeoLocation permission and blocks the position requests by default, if the request origin is a local file (`file://...`). Maybe you should deliver the page via a web server. May you want to start a simple python server with `python server.py`.
